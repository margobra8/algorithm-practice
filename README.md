# Algorithm Practice

This repository contains the statements and my solutions to Algorithm Problem Solving exercises from Hackerrank and TopCoder.

The structure of this repository is as follows:

```
algo/
    n-problemname/		    # problem number and name
        problemname.pdf   # problem statement
        problemname.go              # solution in golang or other language
    ...
```
## Contributing
Contributions are accepted for alternative/improved solutions to the problems but they sould never modify my original proposed solution, that is, it should be commited as an extra file with filename of the form `problemname-{username}.*` in the same directory of the problem to be solved, in any language. `{username}` can be your username or any other text that abides by common sense and respect rules.
